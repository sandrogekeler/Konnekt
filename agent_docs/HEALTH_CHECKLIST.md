# Konnekt — Project Health Checklist

An evergreen yardstick for periodically measuring project health across four
pillars: **Clean, Stable, Scalable/Future-proof, Performant**. Run this check
before each milestone (e.g. alpha → beta) or roughly monthly.

**How to use this doc:** compare the current codebase against the items below.
Do **not** edit this list to match whatever the code currently does — it's the
target, not a snapshot. When a gap is found, track it as an item under
`Open backlog` below (or the repo's issue tracker), fix it, then re-run the
checklist. This file should look almost the same every time you open it; only
the `Open backlog` section should churn. Completed remediation history — the
detailed, per-session narrative of gaps already closed — lives in
`agent_docs/HEALTH_LOG.md`, not here.

See `agent_docs/CLAUDE.md` for architecture conventions and build commands, and
`agent_docs/ROADMAP.md` for feature scope. This doc doesn't duplicate either —
it's the quality gate that sits alongside them.

Canonical local commands (from `CLAUDE.md`):
```bash
go vet ./...           # Go static analysis (repo root)
go test ./...           # Go tests
pnpm typecheck          # tsc --noEmit (from frontend/)
pnpm lint               # ESLint (from frontend/)
wails build              # Production build smoke test
```

---

## 1. Clean

- [x] `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -l .` report nothing.
- [x] No blank `_ =` error-ignores in Go, except documented `//nolint` cases
      (e.g. `backend/services/eventbus.go`). See backlog
      ("P2 — Undocumented blank error-ignores").
- [x] `pnpm lint` runs against a real ESLint config and passes.
- [x] Formatting (Prettier/Biome or equivalent) is consistent and enforced,
      not manual (lefthook pre-commit hook: Prettier + ESLint + `tsc --noEmit`
      on staged frontend files, `gofmt` + `go vet` on staged Go files).
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` has zero errors; no `any` anywhere (CLAUDE.md rule) —
      use `unknown` and narrow instead. One documented exception:
      `frontend/src/tiles/worlds/scene/Sun.tsx` (known `three`/`@react-three/fiber`
      cross-package type mismatch).
- [ ] Nothing under `frontend/wailsjs/` has been hand-edited (it's
      auto-generated; regenerate via `wails generate module` instead).
- [ ] No inline `style={{}}` beyond genuinely dynamic/computed values
      (animation delays, transforms, react-grid-layout position props) —
      Tailwind utilities backed by CSS-variable tokens otherwise (see
      CLAUDE.md's Code style section). `eslint.config.js`'s `no-restricted-syntax`
      rule flags remaining inline styles at `warn`; ratchet per directory to
      `error` as Milestone 2's migration clears each tile.
- [ ] New transition/animation durations and easing curves reuse an existing
      `--duration-*`/`--ease-*` token (`frontend/src/style.css`'s `@theme
      inline` block) unless the motion is genuinely unique (e.g. a one-off
      decorative loop) — no undocumented one-off magic numbers. This isn't
      "all animations must look identical": a snappy hover, a panel
      slide/open-close, and a decorative splash/spin legitimately warrant
      different timing — the goal is a shared vocabulary for the common
      cases, not uniformity.
- [x] No committed build artifacts (`*.syso`, `frontend/dist/`, `build/bin/`)
      — `.gitignore` covers them.
- [x] No stray root-level scratch/design docs left un-triaged (either promoted
      into `agent_docs/` or deleted once the work lands).
- [ ] `agent_docs/CLAUDE.md` and `agent_docs/ROADMAP.md` still reflect the
      actual stack/structure/scope — update them when they drift.
- [ ] No obviously dead code (unused exports, unreachable branches, orphaned
      files) left behind after refactors.

## 2. Stable

- [ ] Automated tests exist and pass for critical paths: RCON client, Modrinth
      API client, backup create/restore, config path-traversal guards,
      scheduler engine (Go); Zustand store logic and critical hooks (frontend).
- [x] CI is green on every push/PR (see backlog: GitHub Actions).
- [ ] All Go methods bound to the Wails `App` struct return `(T, error)`, and
      errors are wrapped with context (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`).
- [ ] Every `EventsOn` listener registered in a component is cleaned up on
      unmount — no leaked subscriptions.
- [ ] No frontend data is driven by `useEffect` polling when it should be a
      Wails event listener (CLAUDE.md rule).
- [ ] Process lifecycle stays safe: Windows Job Object child cleanup intact
      (`backend/services/server_windows.go`), RCON dial/operation timeouts
      present (`backend/services/rcon.go`), Modrinth HTTP client keeps its
      timeout + 429/`Retry-After` retry handling (`backend/services/modrinth.go`).
- [ ] `ErrorBoundary` wraps the app and the UI degrades gracefully when the
      Minecraft server process is offline or unreachable.

## 3. Scalable / Future-proof

- [x] Heavy per-tile dependencies are lazy-loaded on demand, following the
      existing pattern in `frontend/src/tiles/worlds/index.tsx` (`React.lazy`
      + `Suspense`): worlds' three.js/@react-three scene, and now recharts
      (performance tile — see backlog). The backups tile has **no** three.js
      dependency — its "planets" are pure SVG/CSS (`WireframeSphere.tsx`,
      `SolarSystem.tsx`); a repo-wide grep confirms `three`/`@react-three`
      appear only under `worlds/scene/`.
- [x] Production bundle size stays within an agreed budget (550 KB gzip on the
      entry chunk, ~12% headroom over the measured post-split size), checked
      in CI (`frontend/scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`, `pnpm check-bundle`).
- [ ] `frontend/src/tiles/registry.ts` was extended, not restructured, when
      new tiles were added.
- [ ] Each Zustand store still owns exactly one domain — no cross-domain state
      mixing creeping in.
- [ ] Go structs in `backend/models/` remain the single source of truth for
      TypeScript types; bindings were regenerated (`wails generate module`)
      after backend model changes.
- [ ] Dependencies (Go modules, npm packages) are reasonably current, with no
      unmaintained or duplicated libraries doing the same job.
- [ ] New Go dependencies were checked against `agent_docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`
      before being added (create this file if it doesn't exist yet — see
      backlog).
- [x] Local-first invariant holds: no `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` usage;
      all persistence goes through Go file I/O into the Wails app data dir.
      Repo-wide grep confirms zero occurrences under `frontend/src/`. The one
      violation found (scheduler `BlockPalette.tsx`'s palette-collapse and
      per-category-collapse prefs) has been migrated onto `AppSettings` →
      `app_settings.json`, the same Go-backed path console/notify prefs
      already use — see backlog.

## 4. Performant

- [ ] Console log lines are still batched (150ms flush window in `App.tsx`) so
      re-render rate stays bounded on busy servers.
- [ ] Circular/ring buffers still cap memory growth: performance history
      (`usePerformanceHistory.ts`), console buffer (`useConsoleStore.ts`, user
      configurable cap), backend stats history and console ring buffer
      (`backend/services/stats.go`, `backend/services/server.go`).
- [ ] Poll cadences remain deliberate and haven't crept down accidentally: TPS
      RCON poll (~15s, with server-flavor caching), stats tick (~10s),
      scheduler next-run countdown (~30s).
- [ ] Expensive tile subtrees are memoized (`React.memo` / `useMemo` /
      `useCallback`) so parent re-renders don't cascade into them — pay
      particular attention to the 3D scenes (backups sphere, worlds planetary
      system) and chart-heavy tiles.
- [x] Production bundle has been profiled recently (e.g. `vite build` output
      or a bundle analyzer) and heavy libraries remain lazy rather than eager
      (three.js via Worlds, recharts via Performance — see Scalable pillar).

## Open backlog

The remaining, not-yet-closed follow-ups. Each item's full remediation write-up
moves to `agent_docs/HEALTH_LOG.md` once it's done — keep this section short and
current. Priorities mirror the pillars above.

**P1 — Scheduler tile convention gaps** (`frontend/src/tiles/scheduler/`)
- No `useSchedulerStore` — state lives in local `useState` in `useScheduler.ts`,
  violating CLAUDE.md's one-Zustand-store-per-domain rule. Migrate to a store.
- The 30s next-run poll in `useScheduler.ts` should be a Wails event, not
  `useEffect` polling (CLAUDE.md's no-`useEffect`-polling rule).
- `useScheduler` swallows IPC failures silently — surface an offline/error state.

**P1 — Inline styles → Tailwind (Milestone 2, in progress)**
- ~143 `style={{}}` remain across ~35 files. Remaining hotspots: worlds tile
  (~45: `WorldHud.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `scene/`), players tile (~32:
  `PlayerDetailPopup.tsx`, `PlayerRoster.tsx`, `PlayerCard.tsx`), `App.tsx` (6).
  Continue tile-by-tile, then ratchet each directory's `no-restricted-syntax`
  from `warn` → `error` in `frontend/eslint.config.js`. Conversion patterns and
  per-slice lessons: see HEALTH_LOG.md's Milestone 2 slices.

**P1 — Test-coverage follow-ups**
- Modrinth HTTP-path coverage: `ModrinthClient` hardcodes `modrinthBase`; needs
  an injectable base URL before the 429/`Retry-After` retry + search-hit dedup
  paths can be driven by an `httptest.Server`.
- Coverage floor: no numeric threshold in CI yet — add one once a stable
  baseline exists across both suites.

**P2 — Cleanups**
- Missing `--font-mono` theme token: bare `font-mono` (246 usages across 39
  files) falls through to the OS monospace stack, and `style.css` has no
  `@font-face` for JetBrains Mono. Blocked on bundling the font as a webfont
  first, then registering `--font-mono` and auditing existing usages.
- Dead `--panel-bg` CSS variable: `tiles/config/form/widgets.tsx`'s `Select`
  references `var(--panel-bg, #0e1117)`; `--panel-bg` is undefined repo-wide, so
  it always falls through to the literal. Register a real token or repoint to
  `--bg-elevated`.
- Structured logging: replace ad-hoc `fmt.Errorf`-only backend reporting with
  `log/slog`, keeping `EventBus` for UI-facing notifications.
- Memoization pass: add `React.memo`/`useMemo`/`useCallback` to the most
  expensive tile subtrees identified during a profiling pass.
- React Compiler-readiness lint rules: revisit enabling
  `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`'s full `recommended`/`recommended-latest` set (~60
  findings, mostly r3f scene code) once test coverage is in place.

**P3**
- `GetAppVersion() string` (`app.go`) is the only bound `App` method that doesn't
  return `(T, error)` — change to `(string, error)` and update its caller
  (`frontend/src/hooks/useUpdateCheck.ts` / the About pane) when convenient.

**Release follow-ups** (deferred)
- Release-tag-gated full `wails build` packaging job — stronger end-to-end
  confidence than the current `go build`/`pnpm build` CI smoke check.
- macOS release leg + its self-update support (`platformAssetNameFor` is
  structured to add a per-platform case, but no asset-naming/signing story
  exists for macOS yet).
- Code-signing / notarization for the published binaries (unsigned Windows
  builds trigger SmartScreen warnings).
- Second Linux leg for Rocky/RHEL 9 (webkit2gtk-4.0) — would need the updater to
  probe the host's installed webkit version rather than assume 4.1.
